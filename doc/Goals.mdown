### Project Goals 

1. Implement some or all of an interface with one or more classes
2. Extend funcitonality with anonymous Proxies (Decorators)
3. Create short term dependencies with a clear Factory pattern
4. Testing and Mocking are as simple as with normal interfaces
5. Configure implementations at runtime
6. Disconnect a client from implementations
7. Change implementations based on context
8. Clean configuration in both AS and MXML
9. Easily modifiable core functionality.
